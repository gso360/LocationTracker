This directory will contain the iOS native project after running:

npx cap add ios
npx cap sync ios

The directory structure will include:
- App/ (main Xcode project)
- App/App/ (app source files)
- App/App/Assets.xcassets/ (app icons and images)
- App/App/Base.lproj/ (storyboards)
- App/App/Info.plist (app configuration)
- App/App/public/ (web assets)
- App/Podfile (iOS dependencies)

You'll need to run these commands on a Mac with Xcode installed to fully prepare the iOS app for submission.

Refer to ios-app-guide.md for detailed instructions.
